I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in the [Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering](https://eee.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en) at [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/). Since the Fall of 2021, I have been conducting my studies and research as a member of the Robotics Perception & Intelligence Lab (RPILab) under the supervision of Prof. [Max Q.-H. Meng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DxDCU7AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). In 2021, I received my bachelor's degree from Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen. 

<!-- My current research focus on the collaboration of multiple robotic manipulators, deep learning, and robotics manipulation, particularly in deformable objects. My ultimate goal is to enable robots to actively participate in human daily life and provide convenient services to humans. -->
