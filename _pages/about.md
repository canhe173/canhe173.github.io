Hi! Welcome to my personal pages!

I am a Master’s student at [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/) in [Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering](https://eee.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en). I start my study and research as part of the Robotics Perception & Intelligence Lab (RPILab) led by Prof. [Max Q.-H. Meng](https://eee.sustech.edu.cn/?view=%e5%ad%9f%e5%ba%86%e8%99%8e-2&jsid=18&lang=en) from the Fall of 2021.

Prior to that, I received my bachelor’s degree from Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen in 2021.

My research interest lies in the collaboration of multiple robotic manipulators, and robotics manipulation specially in deformable object.
